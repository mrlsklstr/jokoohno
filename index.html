        <p>
Hmm... hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm <br>
Hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm<br>
Hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm<br>
Sometimes in our lives<br>
We all have pain<br>
We all have sorrow<br>
<br>
But if we are wise<br>
We know that there's always tomorrow<br>
<br>
Lean on me<br>
When you're not strong<br>
And I'll be your friend<br>
I'll help you carry on...<br>
<br>
For it won't be long<br>
Till I'm gonna need somebody to lean on<br>
<br>
Please swallow your pride<br>
If I have things you need to borrow<br>
<br>
For no one can fill<br>
Those of your needs that you won't let show<br>
<br>
You just call on me brother when you need a hand<br>
We all need somebody to lean on<br>
<br>
I just might have a problem that you'll understand<br>
We all need somebody to lean on<br>
<br>
Lean on me<br>
When you're not strong<br>
And I'll be your friend<br>
I'll help you carry on...<br>

Till I'm gonna need somebody to lean on<br>

When you need a hand<br>
We all need somebody to lean on<br>

I just might have a problem that you'll understand<br>
We all need somebody to lean on<br>
<br>
If there is a load you have to bear<br>
That you can't carry<br>
<br>
I'm right up the road<br>
I'll share your load<br>
If you just call me<br>
<br>
Call me<br>
If you need a friend<br>
(Call me)<br>
Call me (call me)<br>

        <h2>Song 6: What's Up van 4 Non Blondes</h2>
        <p>
<br>
25 years of my life and still<br/>
I'm trying to get up that great big hill of hope<br/>
For a destination<br/>
I realized quickly when I knew I should<br/>
That the world was made up of this<br/>
Brotherhood of man<br/>
For whatever that means<br/>
<br/>
So I cry somethimes when I'm lying in bed<br/>
To get it all out what's in my head<br/>
Then I start feeling a little peculiar<br/>
So I wake in the morning and I step outside<br/>
I take deep breath, I get real high<br/>
Then I scream from the top of my lungs<br/>
What's goin' on<br/>
And I say hey...<br/>
I say hey what's goin' on<br/>
And I say hey...<br/>
I said hey what's goin' on<br/>
<br/>
oh oh oh oh...<br/>
oh oh oh oh... <br>
And I try, oh my God do I try<br/>
I try all the time<br/>
In this institution<br/>
<br/>
And I pray, oh my God do I pray<br/>
I pray every single day<br/>
For a revolution<br/>
<br/>
So I cry sometimes when I'm lying in my bed<br/>
To get it all out what's in my head<br/>
Then I start feeling a little peculiar<br/>
So I wake in the morning and I step outside<br/>
I take a deep breath and I get real high<br/>
Then I scream from the top of my lungs<br/>
What's goin' on<br/>
And I say hey...<br/>
And I say hey what's goin' on<br/>
And I say hey...<br/>
I said hey what's goin' on<br/>
And I say hey...<br/>
And I say hey what's goin' on<br/>
And I say hey...<br/>
I said hey what's goin' on<br/>
<br/>
25 years of my life and still<br/>
I'm trying to get up that great big hill of hope<br/>

        <p>
<br>
Well sometimes I go out by myself<br/>
And I look across the water<br/>
And I think of all the things, what you're doing<br/>
And in my head I paint a picture<br/>
<br/>
Cos since I've come on home<br/>
Well my body's been a mess<br/>
And I've missed your ginger hair<br/>
And the way you like to dress<br/>
Won't you come on over?<br/>
Stop making a fool out of me<br/>
Why don't you come on over Valerie?<br/>
Valerie? Valerie? Valerie?<br/>
<br/>
Did you have to go to jail?<br/>
Put your house up on for sale?<br/>
Did you get a good lawyer?<br/>
I hope you didn't catch a ten<br/>
I hope you'll find the right man<br/>
Who'll fix it for ya<br/>
And are you shoppin' anywhere?<br/>
Changed the colour of your hair, are you busy?<br/>
And did you have to pay the fine?<br/>
You were dodging all the time, are you still dizzy? <br>
Cos, Since I've come on home<br/>
Well my body's been a mess<br/>
And I've missed your ginger hair<br/>
And the way you like to dress<br/>
Won't you come on over?<br/>
Stop making a fool out of me<br/>

Oh, girl I've known you very well
<br />I've seen you growing everyday

Krijg toch allemaal de kolere

<br />Mijn moeder kan me niet verdragen 
<br />Nooit doe ik iets voor haar goed 
<br />Om liefde hoef ik ook al niet te vragen 
<br />Schelden is alles, wat ze d oet 
<br />
<br />Geen wonder dat mijn pa is gaan varen 
<br />Ik mocht niet mee, ik ben te klein 
<br />Ik moet het in mijn eentje klaren 
<br />Tot ie ooit weer terug zal zijn

<br />REFREIN: 
<br />Had ik maar iemand om van te houden
<br />Twee zachte armen om me heen 
<br />Die mij altijd beschermen zouden
<br />Ik voel me zo verdomd alleen

<br />misschien als vader's schip er is

<br />zegt hij nog eens luister sis waarom ga je niet met me mee

<br />Ik ben toch ook nog maar een kind 
<br />Kan het niet helemaal alleen 
<br />Misschien dat ik ooit het geluk nog vind

<br />Sinds een dag of twee 
<br />aangenaam verdoofd 
<br />'k Was haast vergeten 
<br />hoe 't voelt om verliefd te zijn
<br />Ik kijk om me heen 
<br />door een roze bril 
<br />Veel te lang alleen 
<br />'k Stond een beetje stil 
<br />Hoe kon ik 't weten 
<br />m'n wereldje was zo klein 
<br />
<br />'t Is wel een beetje raar 32 jaar 
<br />Trillend op m'n benen (op m'n benen)
<br />Als ze is verdwenen (is verdwenen)
<br />(oe lalalalala)
<br />Ze is ze is van mij 
<br />(oe lalalalala)
<br />Ze is ze is van mij 
<br />(oe lalalalala)
<br />Ze is ze is van mij 
<br />(oe lalalalala)
<br />
<br />Mannen bij de vleet 
<br />wachtend in een rij 
<br />'t Doet me toch geen reet 
<br />want ze kijkt naar mij 
<br />Liefde oh liefde 
<br />waar was jij toch al die tijd 
<br />
<br />Alles wat ze zegt 
<br />slik ik voor zoete koek

        <h2>Song 13: Fire van The Pointer Sisters</h2>
        <p>
<br>
I'm ridin' in your car, you turn on the radio<br/>
You're pullin' me close, I just say no<br/>
I say I don't like it, but you know I'm a liar<br/>
'Cause when we kiss, ooh, fire<br/>
<br/>
Late at night, you're takin' me home<br/>
You say you wanna stay, I say I wanna be alone<br/>
I say I don't love you, but you know I'm a liar<br/>
'Cause when we kiss, ooh, fire <br>
You had a hold on me right from the start<br/>
A grip so tight I couldn't tear it apart<br/>
My nerves all jumpin', actin' like a fool<br/>
Well, your kisses they burn, but my heart stays cool...<br/>
<br/>
Well, Romeo and Juliet, Samson and Delilah<br/>
Baby you can bet a love they couldn't deny<br/>
My words say split, but my words they lie<br/>
'Cause when we kiss, ooh, fire<br/>
<br/>
Ooh fire...<br/>
Kisses like fire...<br/>
Burn me up with fire<br/>
I like what you're doin now, fire<br/>
Touchin me, fire<br/>
Touchin me, burnin me, fire<br/>
Take me home<br><br>

        <h2>Song 14: Een beetje verliefd van André Hazes</h2>
        <p>
<br>
In `n discotheek, zat ik van de week <br/>
En ik voelde mij daar zo alleen <br/>
Het was er warm en druk, ik zat naast een lege kruk <br/>
Ik verlangde zo naar jou hier aan m'n zij <br/>
Ja, ik denk nog steeds, hoe het was geweest <br/>
Toen je naast me zat hier aan de bar <br/>
Ik vroeg: drink je mee, dat vond jij oke <br/>
Toen je proostend, naar me keek, werd ik zo week <br/>
<br/>
refrein:<br/>
Een beetje verliefd <br/>
Ik dacht `n beetje verliefd <br/>
Als ik wist wat jij toen dacht <br/>
Had ik nooit op jou gewacht <br/>
Als een kind zat ik te dromen <br/>
Deze nacht ben jij voor mij <br/>
Maar die droom ging snel voorbij <br>
Jij stond op en zei, hou m`n plaatsje vrij <br/>
Ik moet even weg maar ben zo terug <br/>
Ach, die kruk bleef leeg, tot ik in de gaten kreeg <br/>
Dat je weg ging zonder mij, ik was weer alleen <br/>
<br/>
refrein: <br/>
Een beetje verliefd <br/>
Ik dacht `n beetje verliefd <br/>
Als ik wist wat jij toen dacht <br/>
Had ik nooit op jou gewacht <br/>
Als een kind zat ik te dromen <br/>
Een beetje verliefd <br/>
Ik dacht een beetje verliefd <br/>
Als ik wist wat jij toen dacht <br/>
Had ik nooit op jou gewacht <br/>
Als een kind zat ik te dromen <br/>
Deze nacht ben jij voor mij<br/>
Maar die droom ging snel voorbij<br><br>

        <h2>Song 15: Don't You Want Me van The Human League</h2>
        <p>
<br>
You were workin' as a waitress in a cocktail bar<br/>
When I met you<br/>
I picked you out, I shook you up and turned you around<br/>
Turned you into someone new<br/>
Now five years later on you've got the world at your feet<br/>
Success has been so easy for you<br/>
But don't forget, it's me who put you where you are now<br/>
And I can put you back down too<br/>
<br/>
[Pre-Chorus: Philip]<br/>
Don't, don't you want me?<br/>
You know I can't believe it when I hear that you won't see me<br/>
Don't, don't you want me?<br/>
You know I don't believe you when you say that you don't need me<br/>
It's much too late to find<br/>
You think you've changed your mind<br/>
You'd better change it back or we will both be sorry<br/>
<br/>
[Chorus: Philip]<br/>
Don't you want me, baby? (4x) <br> 
[Verse 2: Susan Ann Sulley]<br/>
I was working as a waitress in a cocktail bar<br/>
That much is true<br/>
But even then I knew I'd find a much better place<br/>
Either with or without you<br/>
The five years we have had have been such good times<br/>
I still love you<br/>
But now I think it's time I live my life on my own<br/>
I guess it's just what I must do<br/>
<br/>
[Pre-Chorus: Philip]<br/>
Don't, don't you want me?<br/>
You know I can't believe it when I hear that you won't see me<br/>
Don't, don't you want me?<br/>
You know I don't believe you when you say that you don't need me<br/>
It's much too late to find<br/>
You think you've changed your mind<br/>
You'd better change it back or we will both be sorry<br/>
<br/>
[Chorus: Philip]<br/>
Don't you want me, baby? (4x)<br/>
<br/>
[Chorus Repeated Until Fade: Philip]<br/>
Don't you want me, baby? (4x) <br><br>
